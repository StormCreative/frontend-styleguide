## Storm Creative Media in-house Front-End Styleguide

To keep code tidy, maintainable and a little less ugly we need to adhere to a unified Styleguide across the team. This document will cover

Consistency is key, a common formatting must be followed at all times. This is achieved through consistent syntax, commenting and naming conventions.
